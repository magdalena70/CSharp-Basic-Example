//You are given a number n and 2*n numbers. Write a program to check whether the sum
//of the odd numbers is equal to the sum of the even n numbers. The first number is
//considered odd, the next even, the next odd again, etc. Print as result “Yes” or “No”.
//In case of yes, print also the sum. In case of no, print also the difference between
//the odd and the even sums.
//Input
//The input data should be read from the console.
//The first line holds an integer n – the count of numbers.
//Each of the next 2*n lines holds exactly one number.
//The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
//Output
//The output must be printed on the console.
//Print “Yes, sum=S” where S is the sum of the odd n numbers in case of the sum of the odd n numbers is
//equal to the sum of the even n numbers.
//Otherwise print “No, diff=D” where D is the difference between the sum of the odd n numbers and the 
//sum of the even n numbers. D should always be a positive number.
